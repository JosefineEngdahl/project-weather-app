# Weather App

Our assignment was to create a weather app after a specific design and fetch it's data using Openweather API.

## The problem

1 Create index, stylesheet and script from scratch.
2 Working together connecting the API and HTML.
3 Creating two branches for Script and Styling, working on both separately.
4 Merge both branches and connecting files.
5 Mobprogram to finalize the site.

If we had more time we would add a city form to change location and expand time frame for fetching data.

## View it live
